# Rain

Rain was (roughly) the Japanese translation for the English word "line". An earlier version of this project used to take a 1xN as input, but was later converted to a NxN image since it looks a little nicer when you look at the image file.

Rain is an Esoteric Programming Language that interprets encoded images and generates Branflake instructions. I got bored one evening, dont @ me.
